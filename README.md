# Testing out SST

SST seems like a better way to utilize AWS for IaC. This is done for a tutorial and will be implimented in a near future project.

I have made many mistakes during this journey.

I was not too familiar with typescript.
The tutorial provided by the SST team was slightly out of date. I had to look through different versions of the documentation to solve it.
I actually still do not understand how the python lambdas are working.
When I first began learning this, the lambdas written in python could not recognize other modules I have created and could not import those. I have solved it by defining it in a separate function. Or is it because I added the requirements.txt to each folder? This part is still a question I have not yet answered. If someone with a kind soul stumbles on this repo, and if that man finds the answer, please do somehow inform me.

Anyways the issue is solved.

The infrasturcture, the stacks are defined in Typescript and only the lambdas are done in Python just as I wanted it to be.

I am in love with the live lambda dev. I might as well learn this tool for my future projects.
